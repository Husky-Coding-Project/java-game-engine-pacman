**How to switch branches to the working branch**<br>
First, make sure you're working in a project with the main repo as the working repository.<br>
Second, open your terminal inside the IDE <br>
Third, put this command in to check the branch, 'git status' check that it is not 'working-branch'<br>
Fourth, if the branch is not currently the working branch, put in this command, 'git checkout working-branch'<br>
Fifth, check again to see what branch you're currently working in with this command, 'git status', ensure that the<br>
working branch is the 'working-branch'
